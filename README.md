# External
Imported PULP-Trainlib main branch

Future Fork of PULP-Trainlib with model deployers
# Training
This section will detail the training process:
- Where are the models imported from
- Transfer Learning
- On-line learning
- Learning rate exploration and scheduling
- Weight Decay
- Accuracy & Loss charts
- 
  
# TO DO
- import pretrainer.py and eventually modules
- Give dependency list so that users can install them, include commands snippets
- import PULP-TrainLib for deployment of projects on simulated or even real device
- add results of experiments , plots, logs
